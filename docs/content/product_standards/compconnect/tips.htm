            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>Defines structure of tips in CompConnect.</p>
            <h2>Full Description:</h2>
            <p>Tips in Wasabi provide users with additional information about using the software. Tips include content that provides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Non-obvious UI interactions to help prevent users from entering error conditions that could be avoided if they knew about it beforehand.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>At Least One Pay Type from Either Pay Set</b> To avoid mixing amount and percentage data when calculating a value that will be used for market pricing, you must select at least one employee pay component and one survey pay component from either the Pay Set (Amounts) or Pay Set (Percents) section. You cannot select pay components from both sections because the result would include mixed data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Insights into workflow including recommendations, shortcuts, and options that are not part of the core workflow.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example Workflow Recommendation</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Adding Match From Scratch </b>Starting from scratch? Make sure that you have recent survey data from the correct country. Then, start comparing matches by Job Title and Job Description to narrow your results.</p>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example Shortcut</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Change Differential</b> You can change the factors that are used in the Differential calculation in My Settings.</p>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example Non-core workflow</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Job Description Matching</b> Click the book icons in your survey match rows to view job descriptions. Keep the matches that share about 80% of the responsibilities with your job.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Recommendations.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Rename Pay Types</b> To preserve the intent of the standard pay types, Towers Watson recommends that if you rename a pay type, try to use a similar name. For example, you could rename the Base pay type to Basic or Basic Pay; or you could rename Actual Total Cash to Total Cash Compensation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Definitions of key and potentially unfamiliar terms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="NOTE "><span class="autonumber"><span class="TWTeal">NOTE </span></span>Include examples with definitions.</p>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>About Pay Types</b> Your company might define pay differently depending on country, level, region and so on. In the U.S. your company might define Base Pay as just 12-month salary in both the employee pay and survey pay components. While in Germany, your Base Pay might be a combination of 12-month salary, Car Allowance, and Meal Allowance. In this instance, you could have two pay sets associated with the Base Pay pay type—one for the U.S. and one for Germany. Pay sets enable you to easily perform pay comparisons of different pay mixes across different countries using their correct pay definitions, while maintaining the same overall name for the pay type, such as Base Pay.</p>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent">Pay types and their associated pay sets define the pay components used when calculating market values. Pay types are common pay elements, such as base pay or total cash. Pay sets include the employee and survey pay components that further define the pay type. You must associate at least one pay set with each pay type. You can associate multiple pay sets that include different pay components.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Functional advice</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note" data-mc-autonum="NOTE "><span class="autonumber"><span class="TWTeal">NOTE </span></span>Include why you perform an action or examples with any functional advice tips. You are not just explaining how to do something, but you are explaining why the user should do it.</p>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Copy Job Matches</b> Copying matches enables you to consolidate the data from comparable jobs with the market matches that Talent|REWARD generates. You can then edit the candidate job matches that you submit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">More information about a property</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Example More Information</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="thirdbulletIndent"><b>Change the Default Percentile Associated with a Pay Type</b> The default percentile defines the competitive market positioning for the pay type. Users can overwrite the default percentile at the job level if a different percentile is more relevant. You can change the default percentile associated with a pay type.</p>
            <p><b>Guidelines</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Provide the most valuable and insightful information in the first tips associated with a content block. Include the more functional tips after recommendations and workflows.</li>
                <li value="2">Tips should focus on conceptual information and best practices.</li>
                <li value="3">Tips can be stand-alone topics and do not need to be included in Show Me How topics.</li>
                <li value="4">The typical Wasabi user is a moderately skilled user of Excel, so avoid too much detail in functional tips.</li>
                <li value="5">Consider starting your tip with a question such as "Starting from scratch?" or "Want to change the factors in a differential calculation?"</li>
                <li value="6">Focus on the why. Why would a user need to perform a task or why was the application designed to do something a certain way.</li>
                <li value="7">Include examples and use them to frame the topic. Write the story first, followed by the details. For example, "You might need to use multiple pay sets because..." followed by the definition of pay sets in Wasabi.</li>
                <li value="8">Recommendations make great tips. Begin these types of tips with something like "Towers Watson recommends..."</li>
                <li value="9">If the page is affected by settings, include that information in the tips.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Things to Avoid</b>
            </p>
            <p>Avoid including obvious information, such as "to perform a task, click..."</p>
            <p>Avoid any text that directs the user to perform an action, even as part of a recommendation or workflow tip.</p>
